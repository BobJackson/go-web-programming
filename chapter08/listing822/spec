Story: Get a post
In order to display a post to the user
As a calling program
I want to get a post

Scenario 1: using an id
Given a post id 1
When I send a GET request with the id
Then I should get a post

Scenario 2: using a non-integer id
Given a post id "hello"
When I send a GET request with the id
Then I should get a HTTP 500 response
